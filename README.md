**The new face of Open Source Game Launchers**, Lazap, unites all your games together in one place! Whether it's on Windows, Linux or MacOS, we got you covered. Lazap connects with other proprietary game launchers such as Riot Games, Epic Games Launcher and Steam, and collects all of those games and deposits them inside of one place. Lazap is developed to be deeply customizable, meets up to the user's expectance, possess a glancing & modernist look, and isn't expensive at all on hardware consumption. 

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Remarkably lightweight and efficient on hardware resources
- Compatibility across Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms
- Support for clients such as Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, R*, Lutris, etc.
- Flexibility to add and personalize user-set custom games
- Modern and Sleek user interface with theming customization
- Spotify Integration with streamlined music control
- `[Beta]` Cross-Platform Lazap Overlay
- `[WIP]` System monitor, overclock, and benchmarking tools
  
## ‚Äçüíª Installation

Depending on your operating system, we try to provide as much ease in terms of installation:<br>

‚ñ∏ **Windows**: 
- Download and install the latest `.msi` file in the [releases](https://github.com/Lazap-Development/lazap/releases) section.
- Or install via Winget: 
```

```

‚ñ∏ **Linux**: 
- Download and install one of `.deb`, `.tar.zst`, or `.rpm` file in the [releases](https://github.com/Lazap-Development/lazap/releases) section.
