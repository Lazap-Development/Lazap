# Lazap
A native-like attempt to unify your clients with one fast, modern, and cross-platform solution. 

> [!Note]  
> Lazap has undergone a significant rewrite in C++ (even the UI) to better align with the project’s core objectives.
> As part of this refactoring, some features have been removed to streamline development and focus on the project’s primary goals.
> While these features may or may not return, it'll ensure a more stable and purpose-driven evolution of Lazap.
